## "Your process book should include the following topics. Depending on your project type the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:"

## Overview and Motivation: 

> Over the past century, music has transformed dramatically in response to technological innovation, cultural movements, and evolving listener preferences. Modern streaming platforms now capture both large-scale listening behaviors and detailed audio analyses, making it possible to quantitatively study what makes certain songs popular. This project aims to investigate how the musical characteristics of popular tracks have changed from 1921 to 2020 by analyzing a comprehensive Spotify dataset containing over 446,000 songs. We focus on two major categories of musical attributes: technical features, such as tempo, loudness, duration, and key. And perceptive features, Spotify’s machine-generated measures of qualities like danceability, energy, and valence. By examining how these characteristics correlate with popularity and how their distributions shift over time and across genres, our goal is to understand which attributes define popular music in different eras. 


## Related Work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a website, visualizations we discussed in class, etc.

>Our inspiration for this project grew out of our own music tastes and the annual excitement around Spotify Wrapped. Each year, Spotify Wrapped summarizes listeners’ habits by highlighting how their preferences shift across genres, moods, and styles throughout the year. It’s a feature people look forward to and often share on social media, because it offers a personalized snapshot of their musical identity. We wanted to extend this idea beyond the individual level. Rather than examining how one person’s preferences change over a single year, we set out to explore how society’s musical tastes have evolved over the past century. By scaling this kind of analysis up to decades of music and hundreds of thousands of tracks, our project aims to uncover long-term trends in what listeners find popular and how the defining characteristics of music have changed over time.


## Questions: 

> We began with the overarching question; “How have the musical characteristics of popular tracks changed over the past century?” We split this into two separate questions; “What are the (technical and perceptive) features of popular music” and “How have these features changes over time.” Naturally these two questions beget the three graphs we used. 
We found that it was not feasible nor necessary to include all the features of our dataset, so we asked, “what features are significant.” This filter took away the features we were most interested in and left the more trivial ones (e.g. whether or not the track is acoustic, live, etc.). So, we shifted to “what features are audiophiles most interested in.”
To expand our analysis we are also prepared to ask, “how will our patterns shift when we consider genre.”


## Data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.

>Our analysis is based on the Spotify Tracks Dataset (1921–2020) collected by Yamac Eren Ay using the Spotify Web API and publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset contains approximately 446,474 tracks from over 114,000 artists, along with both technical audio features and perceptive attributes generated by Spotify’s machine-learning models. Because the data was gathered through the API rather than scraped manually, it arrives in a structured format with consistent attribute definitions. However, several cleanup steps were necessary before analysis. Our main dataset contained around 500,000 tracks. However, it did not include the attributes for genre of music. So we had to combine it with another dataset which only contained around 100,000 of the tracks. We combined the two datasets using track_id and cleaned the data removing any null values for genre. In our graphs we analyized different tracks by their release year so we had to extract the year from release_date. 



## Exploratory Data Analysis: 

> Diving right into things, we explored our data by plotting each feature against popularity and then against time. This gave us an idea of which features were trivial, and which gave us dramatic results. We did this again but with a genre filter, so we could see the differences across genres. 


## Design Evolution: 

>>>   > Visualization 1

>>>   > Visualization 2

> Visualization 3: The alternative design for this visualization was to replace the bars with boxplots. This would give the viewer substantially more information – a full spread for each bucket rather than only the average. This design, however, was too visually cluttered and added details that did not significantly contribute to the whole of the dashboard. 


## Implementation: 

> The current interaction – the interaction for visualization 3 (perceptive features) – is used to visually isolate the features; to highlight the feature that the user is hovering over. Overall, the graph allows the view to see all three present features and how they change with popularity, and interact with each other. With the interaction, the viewer can focus on one feature at a time. 

> In a future interaction, we will allow the view to select a genre and have each graph shift to show only the data for that genre.
